In humans.\n\nAnd a separate study found them in semen.\n\nNow I'm not saying your polyester shirt is the only source. Microplastics are everywhere — water, air, food.\n\nBut polyester fabric sheds thousands of these particles every time you wear it. Every time you wash it.\n\nAnd that fabric is against your skin. Absorbing into your body. All day.\n\nI switched to hemp and bamboo about a year ago. Zero plastic, zero PFAS, zero microplastics.\n\nI can't undo what's already happened.
